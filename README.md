# BioInformatics-Apps
# This project is still in development 
A step by step guide for learning about bioinformatics all from the convenience of your phone! Based on Opensource University's classes on teaching yourself bioinformatics : https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics
The software runs Ionic for easy multi-platform app design and needs the ionic enviroment installed on your system to properly function. 

This project was initially designed to emulate the ossu bioinformatics webpage and provide people with the knowledge of where to take classes on bioinformatics online for free. 
However, This was also one of the earliest project that I started working on and I really didn't know much about programing at the time. As such it never got to the position that it could be published on the app store, though I will be working on accomplishing that in due course.
