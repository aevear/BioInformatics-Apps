# BioInformatics-Apps

## Overview

This is an ionic based app that I wrote when learning how to program. It was never 100% finished and is still only visible within the Ionic development environment.

Actually its only visible in the older Ionic development environment as the new one has an entirely new structure. I will be attempting to migrate it to the new ionic system in the future.

## What is this app?

A step by step guide for learning about bioinformatics all from the convenience of your phone! Based on Open Source University's classes on teaching yourself bioinformatics : https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics
The software runs Ionic for easy multi-platform app design and needs the ionic environment installed on your system to properly function.

This project was initially designed to emulate the OSSU bioinformatics webpage and provide people with the knowledge of where to take classes on bioinformatics online for free.
